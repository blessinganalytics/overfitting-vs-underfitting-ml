Machine learning project explaining overfitting, underfitting, and model generalization.
Overfitting vs Underfitting in Machine Learning

📌 Overview

This project explains the fundamental machine learning concepts of overfitting and underfitting, focusing on how model complexity affects generalization to new data.

Understanding these concepts is essential for:

- Data science and business analytics
- Predictive modeling and decision-making
- Research in machine learning and AI

🎯 Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you should be able to:

- Distinguish between underfitting, good fit, and overfitting
- Understand the roles of bias and variance
- Recognize the real-world risks of overfitting in:
  - Financial services
  - Healthcare diagnosis
  - Business forecasting
- Apply techniques to prevent overfitting, including:
  - Cross-validation
  - Regularization
  - Early stopping
  - Increasing training data
  - Ensemble methods
  - Feature pruning

🧠 Key Concepts

Underfitting

Occurs when a model is too simple to capture patterns in the data, resulting in:

- High bias
- Poor training and testing performance

Good Fit

A balanced model that:

- Captures the underlying data pattern
- Generalizes well to unseen data

Overfitting

Happens when a model is too complex and memorizes training data instead of learning patterns, leading to:

- High variance
- Poor real-world prediction performance
